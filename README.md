A series of python files to solve the Advent of Code 2021 challenge

I don't remember how I stumbled across this, but I've been finding the Advent of Code to be a pretty fun challenge. 

I'm solving most of these in a Jupyter notebook, but am saving my solutions as standalone python files which output the answers as well.
